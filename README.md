# Description of the Program

This program uses Mapbox to generate a map centered on the MIT campus. There are three files associated with this: mapanimation.js, index.html, and styles.jss. When run, there is a button in a top right corner that will then generate and animate all the bus stops between Harvard and MIT.

# How to Run

To run this program, you must create a Mapbox token. Go to mapbox.com to create an account and generate a token. Then download all the files and store them all in the same folder. In the mapanimations.js file, copy and paste your token over the access token given. Then drag and drop the index.html file onto an open internet browser window.

# Roadmap of Future Improvements

To enhance this program, a button will be added to remove all the map markers. A button will also then be available to allow the user to make the trip in reverse.
